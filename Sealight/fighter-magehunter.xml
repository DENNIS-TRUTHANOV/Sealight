			<p>While magic is common in Sealight, it is not universal To your average citizen, few things are more frightening than a maniac wielding a fireball, or a necromancer defiling graves and communing with the departed This is where the Monterosso Mage Hunter’s Guild comes in hailing from Blackrock, the Mage
Hunters are a collective of wandering mercenaries
who specialize in locating and neutralizing rogue
spellcasters Viewing spellcasters as cowardly and
unnatural, Mage Hunters memorize simple defensive
spells that allow them to close in on their targets,
disabling any active magic before plunging their
weapons into the magician’s squishy, craven heart			</p>

				Also at 1st level, your knowledge of the living mind allows you to unlock its hidden potential. As a bonus action, you may use the mind of one willing creature within 30 feet of you as your holy symbol, so long as the creature has an Intelligence score of 7 or higher. This creature becomes your Conduit, and as long as they are being used in this manner, you have access to the migraine cantrip. Additionally, you are able to communicate telepathically with your Conduit as a bonus action on your turns. This connection is broken if the Conduit is reduced to 0 Hit Points or moves more than 60 feet away from you. Once the connection is broken, you must spend a bonus action reestablishing it.
